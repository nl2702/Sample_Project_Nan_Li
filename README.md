# Sample_Project_Nan_Li

In this project,Â I built a Principal components analysis model that predicts Yield to Maturity of Chinese Funds USD Bonds using macroeconomic factors such as US-Treasury rate, exchange rate, GDP. First I acquired and validated this large dataset and manipulated them into a clean framework. Then I started with linear models but found out that the multicollinearity introduced huge variance for the coefficients. To solve this problem, I tried different methods including reducing the number of predictors, adding ridge and lasso regularization and using PCA models. I found out PCA models deliver the most consistent result both in sample and out of sample.

The Jupyter Notebook has the following contents:

  2. Calculate weighted YTM \
        2.1 Calculate daily average YTM weighted by market cap \
        2.2 Plot YTM         
        2.3 Group by YTM by different rating
        
  3. Load and manipulate Macro data \
        3.1 Change date to to_datetime and set index \
        3.2 Merge all macro data and Average YTM into one big dataframe
        
  4. Run regression \
